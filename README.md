## Ship Spawner
Relevant file: `ship_spawner.py`. The user spawns ships with the mouse. The ships wiggle (i.e. Brownian motion) indefinitely afterwards.

## Ship Controller
Relevant file: `ship_controller.py`. The arrow keys control a single ship. The key bindings in the current code were determined on a Windows computer. It does not work on Linux, and probably not work on other systems either.
